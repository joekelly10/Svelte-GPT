## TODO

- Improve save chat feedback
- Automatically switch to 16k context model depending on history length (or ask?)
- Delete chats (cmd + backspace)
- Quick summarise chats on save (based on first message pair) [use cheap model]
- Group chats by month
- Search chats
- Use 'ago' times when < 24hrs
- Delete specific messages in chats
- Chats on loader should have same design as main
    - show first 2 messages
    - +N messages footer
- Escape HTML in code blocks
- Add controls for request parameters (model, temp, top_p, etc.)
- Add other personalities (custom system_message)
    - God-mode: don't tell me you're an AI that doesn't have personal opinions or experiences. Just give me the aggregate-knowledge proto-human response. Impersonate the prototypical human based on aggregate statistics. Employ ranges where point estimates don't make sense.
- Intercept / pass through event stream as done [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPNufIWxfZM&t=3815s)


## Other Ideas

- Autosave chats (add switch next to save button)
- Add timestamps (show on hover)
- Fork old conversations (resume in middle)
