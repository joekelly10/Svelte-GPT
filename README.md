# What?

*Svelte GPT* is a Chat UI for interacting with language model APIs.

- Frontend: [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- Backend: [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
- Database: [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/)

It runs in your browser on `localhost:1337`.



# Why?

- 🤖 Use multiple models
    - Have a conversation with `gpt-4o` then switch to `Claude 3.5 Sonnet`
    - Ask the same question to multiple models
- 🔧 Control model settings (`temperature`, `top_p`, etc.)
- 📝 Control the `system_prompt`
- 🚀 Quickly launch a new chat from anywhere (e.g. via Alfred)
    - I.e. You can input a prompt + select which model to use via URL query parameters
- 📐 Fork chats
    - Surprisingly useful feature!
    - I don't think anyone has done this yet
    - But I use it all the time
- 🔍 Searchable history
- 💰 API usage / per token pricing means you:
    - 🤝 Save up to $25/mo vs. ChatGPT Plus if you don't actually use it that much
    - 🤝 Save up to $50+/mo compared to 2+ monthly subscriptions to multiple services

7. Go to `http://localhost:1337` and start chatting.



# Please Note

This isn't finished, production ready code - it's a personal project that I originally had no intention of sharing. I could be persuaded to develop it properly, but it works for my needs and I'm currently focused on other things!
