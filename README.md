## TODO

- Use 'ago' times when < 24hrs
- ctrl+L = load
- ctrl+S = save
- Delete chats
- Delete specific messages in chats
- Keyboard nav on load
- Search saved chats
- Set chat_id in url
- Organise onMount on Input
- Add components folder
- Make UI for viewing + loading saved chats (full-screen grid with first message)
- Quick summarise chats on save (based on first message) [use cheap model]
- Automatically switch to 16k context model depending on history length (or ask?)
- Disable save button while streaming
- Escape HTML in code blocks
- Add GPT-4 switch
    - (including in the middle of conversations)
- Add controls for request parameters (model, temp, top_p, etc.)
- Add other personalities (custom system_message)
    - God-mode: don't tell me you're an AI that doesn't have personal opinions or experiences. Just give me the aggregate-knowledge proto-human response. Impersonate the prototypical human based on aggregate statistics. Employ ranges where point estimates don't make sense.
- Add Avatars
- Intercept / pass through event stream as done [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPNufIWxfZM&t=3815s)


## Other Ideas

- Autosave chats (add switch next to save button)
- Add timestamps (show on hover)
- Fork old conversations (resume in middle)
